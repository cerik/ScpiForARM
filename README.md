# ScpiForARM
This project is for the embeded platform solution of SCPI & LWIP & USB. 
LwIP and USB library are come from ST,and scpi from scpi-paser,created by Jan Breuer.
Now, these code are compiled by Keil, for microcontroller of STM32.Also, it can be transfered
into MSP430 or other platform.
The program just be compiled without error, but not be tested on the demo-board.
